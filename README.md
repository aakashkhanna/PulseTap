# PulseTap
PulseTap Android App is needed in case of a medical emergency. The user can place an emergency CPR or Blood donation request with the nearest first respon-
der. The user of the application needs to configure the application for the first time use where the user will fill in a registration form (that will help in getting
the basic medical details of the user). In case of emergency the system will find out the nearest first responder based on the current location of the user and the
user can also track the current location of the first responder once their request has been accepted. The App also has a built in CPR Helper which has the nec-
essary resources for someone who needs to perform CPR. PulseTap provides an integrated approach to emergency health care and coordinated response across
the health-care ecosystem especially focused on 3 aspects First Responders, Blood Donation, and Hospital services.
